# URL Shortentener

As a Junior in high school, I wanted to become more familiar with the backend side of development, so I created a link shortener that uses `Flask` and `SQLite`. 

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConnorSwis/url-shortener
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a secret key in [.env](./.env).

## Usage

```bash
python src/main.py
```

A development server will open at http://localhost:5000/.
